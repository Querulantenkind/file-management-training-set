# Data Lab Track

The Data Lab contains purpose-built datasets and log files for advanced text-processing, parsing, and reporting exercises. Each file is intentionally noisy so you can practice chaining together tools like `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, and `cut` to extract actionable insights.

## Directory Overview

- `logs/` – Raw application, access, and ETL pipeline logs with mixed formats
- `datasets/` – CSV/TSV files covering e-commerce transactions, IoT sensor readings, and support tickets
- `reports/` – Analyst briefs that describe real-world investigation prompts

Use these files to complete the new Text Processing & Data Science track in `EXERCISES.md`.
